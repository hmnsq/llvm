/// RewriteRope is a "strong" string class, designed to make insertions and
/// deletions in the middle of the string nearly constant time (really, they are
/// O(log N), but with a very low constant factor).
///
/// The implementation of this datastructure is a conceptual linear sequence of
/// RopePiece elements.  Each RopePiece represents a view on a separately
/// allocated and reference counted string.  This means that splitting a very
/// long string can be done in constant time by splitting a RopePiece that
/// references the whole string into two rope pieces that reference each half.
/// Once split, another string can be inserted in between the two halves by
/// inserting a RopePiece in between the two others.  All of this is very
/// inexpensive: it takes time proportional to the number of RopePieces, not the
/// length of the strings they represent.
///
/// While a linear sequences of RopePieces is the conceptual model, the actual
/// implementation captures them in an adapted B+ Tree.  Using a B+ tree (which
/// is a tree that keeps the values in the leaves and has where each node
/// contains a reasonable number of pointers to children/values) allows us to
/// maintain efficient operation when the RewriteRope contains a *huge* number
/// of RopePieces.  The basic idea of the B+ Tree is that it allows us to find
/// the RopePiece corresponding to some offset very efficiently, and it
/// automatically balances itself on insertions of RopePieces (which can happen
/// for both insertions and erases of string ranges).
///
/// The one wrinkle on the theory is that we don't attempt to keep the tree
/// properly balanced when erases happen.  Erases of string data can both insert
/// new RopePieces (e.g. when the middle of some other rope piece is deleted,
/// which results in two rope pieces, which is just like an insert) or it can
/// reduce the number of RopePieces maintained by the B+Tree.  In the case when
/// the number of RopePieces is reduced, we don't attempt to maintain the
/// standard 'invariant' that each node in the tree contains at least
/// 'WidthFactor' children/values.  For our use cases, this doesn't seem to
/// matter.
///
/// The implementation below is primarily implemented in terms of three classes:
///   RopePieceBTreeNode - Common base class for:
///
///     RopePieceBTreeLeaf - Directly manages up to '2*WidthFactor' RopePiece
///          nodes.  This directly represents a chunk of the string with those
///          RopePieces concatenated.
///     RopePieceBTreeInterior - An interior node in the B+ Tree, which manages
///          up to '2*WidthFactor' other nodes in the tree.
